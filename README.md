Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Game room is a client that is requesting our services. We are to explain the different components that are required to host The Gaming Rooms game. We will be explaining the types of operating systems, memory storage management systems, and the distributive systems.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe I made a well understood UML Diagram.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I enjoyed the UML Diagram because It helped me understand how the game would work form a logical point of view.
  
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I could revise any part of the document I would revise the Explination of the Development tools. I still don't understand what makes a good programming language out side of overall speed of a language. I've been doing some research of my own and noticed that embedding a language inside of a language is a common practice so I'd maybe look into recommending going that approach. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I thought about the design of the game and it's use cases to make the best recommendations I could. Some of the considerations are the number of users and the need for expantion. It's important to consider the user's needs because without know wha the user needs then the best solution can't be offered. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Form another class I've learned of Agile development which is the method of breaking the job down into smaller sections to be more productive during each section.
